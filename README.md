# CTCI Python Playground

## Context and Acknowledgements
As the name states, this repository's primary objective is to give aspiring developers a practice playground to solve the 6th edition of Cracking the Coding Interview (CTCI), by Gayle Laakmann McDowell. This repository contains questions, solutions (which I am iteratively adding), and test cases to test out your solutions against. 

I was inspired to create this repository by [Hui Wang's CTCI repository](https://github.com/huiwang/cracking-the-coding-interview), which also provides developers with a CTCI practice playground, but in Java.
